Here is my updated and most recent portfolio created in Reactthat I will continue to develop over time as my skills progress.

I have an "About Me" section with a brief bio about myself and how I began this process.
My "Work" section has my latest Projects and successful homework assignments with their deployed websites and a "Contact Me" portion with my GitHub and LinkedIn accounts connected.
