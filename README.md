Here is my updated and most recent portfolio created in Reactthat I will continue to develop over time as my skills progress.

I have an "About Me" section with a brief bio about myself and how I began this process.
My "Work" section has my latest Projects and successful homework assignments with their deployed websites. The "Contact Me" portion has my contact information and if you click on "Resume" a pdf copy of my resume will be downloaded.
